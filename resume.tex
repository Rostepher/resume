\section{\mysidestyle Objective}
	I am looking for a three to six month co-op starting anywhere from now to June.

\section{\mysidestyle Summary}
	I am a person who loves to tinker. I spend the majority of my free time working on personal projects. Some of the projects I have worked on include the Linux kernel and the Gentoo Linux distribution.  As a result, I've found that I have become very good at picking up new ideas quickly, and expanding what I already know with little more than the internet and a direction.
